1. The time required for servicing transmissions is normally distributed with  = 45 minutes and  = 8 minutes. The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 minutes after the car is dropped off and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour from drop-off. What is the probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment?
A. 0.3875
B. 0.2676
C. 0.5
D. 0.6987

Answer B because X is 60 minutes,car drop work starts after 10 minutes of car drop.
(pnorm(50,mean=45,sd=8))   #### probability of success
1-(pnorm(50,mean=45,sd=8))   #### probability of commiting wrong
0.2659855

Ans : B

2. The current age (in years) of 400 clerical employees at an insurance claims processing center is normally distributed with mean  = 38 and Standard deviation  =6. For each statement below, please specify True/False. If false, briefly explain why.

A. More employees at the processing center are older than 44 than between 38 and 44.

Ans : FALSE ,probability of employees being older than 44 is 0.1586 which is less than propbaility of people being lesser than r equal to age 44.

> pnorm(44,mean=38,sd=6,lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 0.1586553

P(38<X<44)=P(38-38/6 < X < 44-38/6)
          =P(0 < x < 1)
          =0.5000+ 0.8413
          =1.3413

B. A training program for employees under the age of 30 at the center would be expected t0 attract about 36 employees.

Ans : TRUE

pnorm(30,mean=38,sd=6)
400*0.09=36

3. If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? Discuss both their distributions and parameters.

Sums of two normal r.v.’s: In the case the Xi’s are already normal, the associated sums and random samples are exactly normal.	
Results in sum of parmeters too,X1 + X2 is normal N(µ1 + µ2, σ21 + σ22)
Sum of means and variances

multiple copies of same r.v = This will follow normal distribution with mean
2µ and variance 4σ2
 
4. Let X ~ N(100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99.
A. 90.5, 105.9
B. 80.2, 119.8
C. 22, 78
D. 48.5, 151.5
E. 90.1, 109.9

pnorm(151.5,mean=100,sd=20) = 0.99

Ans : D
